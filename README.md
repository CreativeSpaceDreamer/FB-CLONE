# FB-CLONE

## Local Preview

Chrome and other browsers can flag hosted Facebook lookalikes, so view the clone locally:

1. git clone https://github.com/CreativeSpaceDreamer/FB-CLONE.git
2. cd FB-CLONE
3. Open index.html in your browser (double-click it or use your editor's Live Server).

All required CSS and webfonts live in the css/ directory, so no build step is needed.
